# Photography-Website
Photography Portfolio Website

Made a minimalistic photography website using css flexbox.

The site lacks anykind of functionality other than a basic navigation bar and a contact form.

The intent was to eventually add some JavaScript to the site to improve the contact form, as well as the portfolio page.

Over all, it shows a good understanding of the flexbox model, solid html mark-up structure understanding as well as good practical use example for front-end development.
